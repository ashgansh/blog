<!-- /react-text --><p data-reactid="25"><!-- react-text: 26 -->Maybe I should start with an introduction about what this blog is going to be about.
The truth is: I don&#x27;t know yet. I need a place to summarize and organize my thoughts and putting it on the Interweb seems to be where all the cool kids do it.<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 27 -->

<!-- /react-text --><p data-reactid="36"><!-- react-text: 37 -->I&#x27;ve always been fascinated by how certain people are able to break down complex issues into manageable chunks.<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 38 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p data-reactid="39"><!-- react-text: 40 -->Yuval Noah Harari, Historian, author of Sapiens, is one of those people. Here&#x27;s a quote from one of the early pages of the book:<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 41 -->
<!-- /react-text --><blockquote data-reactid="42"><!-- react-text: 43 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p data-reactid="44"><!-- react-text: 45 -->The story of atoms, molecules, and their interactions is called chemistry.<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 46 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p data-reactid="47"><!-- react-text: 48 -->About 3.8 billion years ago, on a planet called Earth, certain molecules combined to form particularly large and intricate structures called organisms. The story of organisms is called biology.<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 49 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p data-reactid="50"><!-- react-text: 51 -->About 70,000 years ago, organisms belonging to the species Homo sapiens started to form even more elaborate structures called cultures.<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 52 -->

<!-- /react-text --><p data-reactid="54"><strong data-reactid="55"><!-- react-text: 56 -->BOOM!<!-- /react-text --></strong><!-- react-text: 57 --> (no that&#x27;s not the sound of a bomb getting of, you&#x27;re fine)<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 58 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p data-reactid="59"><!-- react-text: 60 -->Ok, maybe you&#x27;re thinking: &quot;Of course you two-legged monkey!&quot;. And maybe you even know some better insults.<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 61 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p data-reactid="62"><!-- react-text: 63 -->But, that would be beside the point. And the point is that this sets the tone for an interesting novel, a novel about human history but more importantly a person trying to answer:
&quot;How can summarize human history inside a single book&quot;. It is no easy task.<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 64 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p data-reactid="65"><!-- react-text: 66 -->I will not go into details about what is discussed in the book I&#x27;d rather do a meta-analysis on the author style and how it altered my behavior.<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 67 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p data-reactid="68"><!-- react-text: 69 -->And no single sentence affected me more than the following:<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 70 -->

<!-- /react-text --></ul><!-- react-text: 106 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p data-reactid="107"><!-- react-text: 108 -->But think about it: If there&#x27;s no Why then by definition it does not matter. The fact that the why is valid or not is a subject for another meta-discussion.<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 109 -->
